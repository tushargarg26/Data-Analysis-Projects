🚀 Unlocking Business Insights with Power BI! 📊

This is an E-commerce Website Annual Sales Report Dashboard built using Power BI! 💡

In this project, I analyzed a large-scale e-commerce dataset from Kaggle to extract key business insights and enhance data-driven decision-making. The interactive dashboard includes:

✅ Sales Performance Tracking – Monitoring revenue trends across different time periods.
✅ Customer Behavior Analysis – Understanding purchase patterns and preferences.
✅ Product & Category Insights – Identifying best-selling products and areas for improvement.
✅ Dynamic Visualizations & KPIs – Providing real-time insights for better business strategy.

Through data visualization and interactive slicers, this dashboard enables businesses to identify key revenue drivers, optimize sales strategies, and improve operational efficiency. Here's what it uncovers:

✅ Total Sales: 💰 $12.64M, with a $1.47M profit across all channels.
✅ Top Performing Countries: 🇺🇸 United States leads with 42.46% of total sales, followed by Australia, France, China, and Germany.
✅ Best-Selling Categories: 📦 Technology ($4.7M) outperforms Furniture ($4.1M) and Office Supplies ($3.8M).
✅ Shipping Mode Preference: 🚚 Standard Class (7.58M) is the most used, significantly ahead of other modes.
✅ Top 3 Sales Regions: 📍 England, California, and Île-de-France contribute the highest revenue.

This project has strengthened my expertise in data visualization, analytics, and business intelligence. Looking forward to exploring more business intelligence, analytics, and Power BI applications! Let’s connect and discuss insights-driven solutions! 🚀📊
